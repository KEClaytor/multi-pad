# Multi-Pad

Multi-button illuminated pad with multiple modes; free-play, game, addition, multiplication, etc.

This project is pretty simple hardware-wise, but flexible enough that it can be programmed with plenty of neat functions.
For example, you could label the buttons and turn it into a simple calculator. My audience is just learning addition and subtraction, so we made a couple of simple math games and a puzzle game.

Here's the summary video:
